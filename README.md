# CS570-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms

Course Overview

This course introduces the most commonly used data structures, as well as sorting algorithms, using the Java programming language. Data structures that are introduced and compared include arrays, lists, stacks, queues, trees, priority queues, and maps, such as hash tables. Relevant principles including encapsulation, interfaces, and testing are presented along with the data structures, while asymptotic complexity analysis is also introduced. Students implement and test programs that use the above data structures in conjunction with algorithms such as insertion, selection, merge, and quick sort.

Course Outcomes
After successful completion of this course, students will be able to do the following:

Data Types: Understand the notion of Abstract Data Types and their use in object-oriented designs.

Complexity:  Calculate the Big O of diverse non-recursive algorithms and use it to compare efficiency.

Collections:  Use and understand the Collection class in Java, with a major emphasis on Lists, Stacks, and Queues. Implement double linked lists in Java. 

Trees:  Implement Binary Search Trees, Max/Min-Heaps, Priority Queues in Java, and understand the basic concepts of self-balancing Binary Search Trees

Sets-Maps:  Understand what are Sets and Maps, and more specifically implement hash tables in Java.

Recursion:  Understand and implement recursive algorithms, and data structures.

Programming:  Combine different classes together to implement big programming assignments in Java that combine some of the data structures studied in class.
